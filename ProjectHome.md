For now this project will not be developed any further, as the project's term ended. As a result, we don't have any testing / developing materials anymore. However, due to the results we got in just 8 weeks of development, we may decide to pick this project up later and develop it to a usable product, including the hardware.

This would mean that, when and if it is finished, this project might provide you with a 100 Ms/s, 2 channel oscilloscope for your Android phone/tablet, with a hardware cost of around $100,-


# About OscDroid #
This app is written as an educational project to use an Android tablet / phone as oscilloscope. Data and control is done via USB Host API, additional hardware is required for full oscilloscope functionality. The app works from Android 4 and higher.

Short demonstration of the entire end result:
